# tree-sitter-wat

This project is written from scratch, not a fork of [wasm-lsp/tree-sitter-wasm](https://github.com/g-plane/tree-sitter-wat).

## Differences

- Focuses on `*.wat` only, no `*.wast`.
- Be simple.
- Follows up latest WebAssembly features, including [Wasm 3.0](https://webassembly.org/news/2025-09-17-wasm-3.0/) and some Phase 4 and Phase 3 proposals.
